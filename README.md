# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). We apply preprocessing techniques such as normalization, data augmentation, and one-hot encoding to prepare the data for training. 

The project includes implementations of multiple neural networks, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and LeNet architecture to classify the digits accurately.

Technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.

To run this project, clone the repository and follow the steps outlined in the notebook.
